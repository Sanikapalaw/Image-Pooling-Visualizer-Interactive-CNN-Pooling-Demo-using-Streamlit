# Image-Pooling-Visualizer-Interactive-CNN-Pooling-Demo-using-Streamlit
Interactive Image Pooling Playground is a Streamlit app that visualizes CNN pooling operations. Users can upload an image, convert it to a grayscale matrix, and apply max, min, or average pooling with custom window sizes. Numerical grids help clearly understand how pooling works.
